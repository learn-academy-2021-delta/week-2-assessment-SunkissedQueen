# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is any method or process that allows a function or code to be executed throughout the entire length of a string, array, or object. For instance, for loop or .map() are ways to iterate across a parameter. Be aware of the datatype because each respond to a certain style of iteration.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of executing code until a condition is met.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map takes value, index, an array as predefined parameters. All are optional to use; however, one needs to be designated. (Just had an epiphany about errors I have received using .map() before.)

  Researched answer: .map() is not concerned with the name of parameters; however, the order of the parameters will always be the same---(value, index, array). The value is a required parameter while index and array are optional.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is a method that allows keys and values in an object to be called upon by their value or index.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is a special technique to assign variables. In other words, breaking the properties of an object into separate, recallable variables. This technique comes in handy when coding objects with nested properties.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: The difference between a function and a method!!! Well, a function is the executable code that uses a series of methods and variables to perform an action and produce an output based on information introduced externally. A method is the structure or key words that help do the heavy lifting in the code. Methods allow the code to be easier to read and less wordy. This feature is wonderful when a person is troubleshooting errors or trying to update a code block.

  Researched answer: Functions are the hierarchy of shortcuts. They can be rendered by name and can standalone. The data passed through the function is limited by the approved parameters that will be manipulated the code block executed through the function. Methods are tools that can be used by a function. However, methods oare executed once the name of the object it is assigned to is called. A method is associated the property of an object.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I like to think of a grocery store when thinking of a class and an object. The class is like the grocery store, filled with various data that can be used to build a hearty meal (object). The object can be pulled from the placeholders within various classes.

  Researched answer: Classes, which only need to be declared once, are used to create objects. They cannot be manipulated because they do not take up memory space. Objects only similarity to classes is that its values are extracted from a class. Objects take up memory and can be manipulated. They can also be created as many times as needed.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I am not familiar with the term in the Javascript sense. However, I have use physical hoists. Based on that experience, I am assuming that hoisting in JavaScript relates to a process or method that supports lifting, transporting, or moving parameters.

  Researched answer: I truly appreciate this question because I was certainly going to ask about where to make declarations when writing code blocks. Hoisting and being aware of the scope of the code block are splendid. If a variable is created before it is declared, you will certainly receive a FAIL banner. However, declaring the variable at the top of the scope will removes those errors. JavaScript is helpful in having a default behavior called hoisting that will move all declarations to the top of the scope. Nevertheless, the initialization of the variable (value) will not be hoisted. Therefore, don't rely on the default of hoisting to make the code executable. Place the variables at the top of the code block to keep the bugs at a minimum.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: allow classes not only share similar attributes and behavior but also have additional traits that are unique

2. React: JavaScript tool used to build webpages and mobile applications

3. React state: an object that both stores interchangeable data and determines the behavior of the data

4. React lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting a component into DOM

5. DOM: the interface that allows programming languages to manipulate web documents
