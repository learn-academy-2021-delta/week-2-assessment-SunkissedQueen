# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is any method or process that allows a function or code to be executed throughout the entire length of a string, array, or object. For instance, for loop or .map() are ways to iterate across a parameter. Be aware of the datatype because each only respond to a certain style of iteration.

4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: The difference between a function and a method!!! Well, a function is the executable code that uses a series of methods and variables to perform an action and produce an output based on information introduced externally. A method is the structure or key words that help do the heavy lifting in the code. Methods allow the code to be easier to read and less wordy. This feature is wonderful when a person is troubleshooting errors or trying to update a code block.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I like to think of a grocery store when thinking of a class and an object. The class is like the grocery store, filled with various data that can be used to build a hearty meal (object). The object can built pulled from the placeholders within various classes.
